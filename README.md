For this years Xmas meal, we have a shared YouTube playlist that people can add music they'd like to be played to.

This will be a Britain's Got Talent style buzzer so allow people to veto songs.

It will be a buzzer button that when enough (configurable) have been pressed, the video will be skipped.

This will possibly be done with a Python script sending an 'end' key to the video.

Todo:

- [x] Make a buzzer button web page
- [ ] Style the buzzer
- [ ] Make the number of buzzer presses required to be configurable
- [x] Keep a count of the number of buzzer GETs recieved
- [ ] Fix the Python keys script (or come up with another way to do this)
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Tests
